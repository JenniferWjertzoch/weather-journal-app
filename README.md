# Weather-Journal App Project

## Overview
In this project I created an asynchronous web app that uses Web API and user data to dynamically update the UI.

## Node & Express Environment
* Set up a Node and Express environment to develop a web application on your local machine
* Install JavaScript packages using npm (Node Package Manager)
* Setup and run a local development server
* Manage web application file structure and website assets using Express

## HTTP Requests & Routes
* Handle requests to an Express with routes
* Describe and explain the differences between GET and POST requests
* Build a web server and use it to serve data and responses to web requests

## Asynchronous JavaScript
* Manage asynchronous JavaScript control flow with Promises
* Request data from a server using JavaScript Fetch
* Update and modify website elements dynamically using asynchronously retrieved data
